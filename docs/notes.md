## Notes on How Transformers Work

Transformers only work using AC current since we need to use induction to transfer energy from one coil to another.

AC has a variable magnetic field, which is essential for induction. The changing magnetic field induces a voltage in the secondary coil, allowing energy transfer.

The difference between two interavting coils is that one coil is connected to the AC source (primary coil) and the other is connected to the load (secondary coil). The primary coil creates a magnetic field when AC flows through it, and this magnetic field induces a current in the secondary coil.

Electromotive Force (EMF) is induced in the secondary coil due to the changing magnetic field created by the primary coil. The amount of EMF induced depends on the rate of change of the magnetic field and the number of turns in the secondary coil.

Engineers put ferromagnetic materials in the core of the transformer to enhance the magnetic field. This increases the efficiency of energy transfer between the coils.

Laminated cores are used to reduce eddy currents, which can cause energy loss in the transformer. Eddy currents are loops of electric current induced within the core material due to the changing magnetic field.

#### Step up and Step Down Transformers

Step-up transformers increase voltage from primary to secondary (more turns in secondary coil) (current decreases). Step-down transformers decrease voltage (more turns in primary coil) (current increases). Both maintain power (P=VI).

Power companies use step-up transformers to increase voltage for long-distance transmission, reducing energy loss. At the destination, step-down transformers reduce voltage for safe use in homes and businesses.
